## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to your project. Explain the purpose and goals of your data structures and algorithms collection. You can also mention the motivation behind the project and its significance.

## Data Structures

List the data structures you've implemented in your project. Include a brief description of each data structure and how it is organized within your repository.

1. **Linked List:** A singly linked list implementation.
2. **Binary Search Tree:** A binary search tree implementation.
3. ...

For each data structure, you can provide a brief explanation and link to the corresponding code file.

## Algorithms

List the algorithms you've implemented in your project. Include a brief description of each algorithm and how it is organized within your repository.

1. **Quick Sort:** An efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer strategy.
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** A shortest path algorithm.
3. ...

For each algorithm, provide a brief explanation and link to the corresponding code file.

## Usage

Explain how to use your data structures and algorithms. Provide code examples or usage instructions. You can also include any prerequisites or dependencies required to run the code.

```python
# Example usage of the Binary Search Tree
from binary_search_tree import BinarySearchTree

bst = BinarySearchTree()
bst.insert(5)
bst.insert(3)
bst.insert(8)
print(bst.search(3))  # Should print True
